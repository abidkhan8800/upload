 ## Q. What I have used?
* Express – building Server
* Multer – handing Images
* Ejs – view Engine
* Cors – allowing user to access his/her own locaclhost
 
 ## Q.Why I have used these?

 * Multer is a very easy package  to use.
 * You will find a lot of resources for it online.
    
 ## Q. What it Does?
This is a simple code which will allow you to add photos to server. Frist when you start the app you will see the homepage with a form to upload photos.You can click on choose photos button to select files, a new window will pop where you can browse to the folder to select the image/images. Once you select the images that you want to upload and click on upload.You can see the status of your process below the upload button.
There are several condtions that I,ve used 
* you can upload upto 5 photos at once.
* image size cannot be larger than 4MB.
* you can upload only image filetypes.
